| **Theory-driven development of educational design and methods** | <ul><li>Situated in a real educational context<li>Focused on the design and testing of a significant intervention</ul> |
| **Applied iterative theory developed with practitioners** | <ul><li>Testing of design and methods shapes revision of theory; Revised theory offers insight into design and methods revisions<li>Emphasizes mixed-methods approaches and collaboration</ul> |
| **Should have impact in both research and practice** | <ul><li>Develops research-driven design theory for use by other researchers<li>Provides guidance for adoption by other practitioners</ul> |

| **Historiography-driven development of tools and methods to use those tools in order to answer questions about change and continuity over time** | <ul><li>Situated in historiography<li>Focused on the gaps between historiographic need and existing design and method</ul> |
| **Refine and iterate design & methods based on resulting historical argument and how that argument fits into existing historiography** | <ul><li>Small-scale testing to evaluate how tool/method design shape historical argument<li>Revised argument offers insight into design and methods revisions<li>Emphasizes mixed-methods approaches through proof-of-concept collaboration</ul> |
| **Should have mpact in both argument-driven history and digital history** | <ul><li>Produces tools designed for and by other historians<li>Articulates methods that link tools to appropriate continuity-and-change questions<li>Contributes to historiography through change/continuity-over-time arguments</ul> |
